After a Master degree in Genetics at [Magistère Européen de Génétique](http://www.magisteregenet.univ-paris-diderot.fr/),
Paris Diderot, I did a second [Master in bioinformatics](https://sciences-techniques.univ-nantes.fr/formations/masters/fiches-formations-master/master-bio-informatique-2029398.kjsp)
at University of Nantes where I focused my work on the study of mapping strategy for allele specific analysis at the
[bioinformatics platform of Institut Curie](https://science.institut-curie.org/platforms/bioinformatics/).

I then joined Institut Pasteur to work on an [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) project related to
the [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) registry through the development of a dedicated tool
([ToolDog](https://github.com/bio-tools/tooldog)) and the participation of several workshops and hackathons.
Then as an engineer of the [Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/bioinformatics-and-biostatistics-hub/),
I was involved in several projects from Differential Analysis of RNA-seq data to Metagenomics.
I was also in charge of the maintenance of the [Galaxy Pasteur instance](https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/).

After few experiences in private companies where I could improve my Python skills and be sensitize
to production constraints, I came back to Institut Pasteur in April 2019. My work mainly focuses on
Metagenomics analysis. I am involved in bioinformatics analysis, by using existing tools and developing
what is necessary for our analysis. I am also involved in the development a
[Python library for analysis of metagenomics counts](https://github.com/motleystate/moonstone) and a
[dedicated web application](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/metagenomics/metagenedb) to browse through gene catalogs.
