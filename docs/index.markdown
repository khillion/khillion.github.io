In the context of my research engineer position at Institut Pasteur, I am currently involved
in the following projects:

Projects | Techs | Description
-------- | ----- | -----------
[MetageneDB](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/metagenomics/metagenedb) | Django REST framework, Vue.js, PostgreSQL, Docker-compose, Kubernetes | The main motivation behind MetageneDB is to provide a support for all the analysis that are based on gene catalogs. It is composed of both an API and a client side for visualization and interaction with the DB.
[Moonstone](https://github.com/motleystate/moonstone) | Python | Library to provide a way of performing analysis of metagenomics counts from raw data to statistical analysis and visualization of the results.
[Dabeplech](https://github.com/motleystate/dabeplech) | Python (Pydantic) | Light library to perform requests to different bioinformatics APIs or scrap data of interest.
